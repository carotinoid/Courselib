There is a repository for the assignments in Computer Architecture course: [CSED311-computer-architecture](https://github.com/carotinoid/CSED311-computer-architecture)

All assignments are implemented in Verilog.

Here, the explanations of each assignment are following:
- **Assignment 1**: Implement ALU and vending machine, to get familiar with Verilog and simulation tools.
- **Assignment 2**: Implement a single-cycle CPU.
- **Assignment 3**: Implement a multi-cycle CPU.
- **Assignment 4-1**: Implement a pipelined CPU, but without control-flow hazards (only predict pc to pc+4 (next instruction)).
- **Assignment 4-2**: Implement a complete pipelined CPU, with control-flow hazards (branch prediction, BHSR).
- **Assignment 5**: Implement a cache.

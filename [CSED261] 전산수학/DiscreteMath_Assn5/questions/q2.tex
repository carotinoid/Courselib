if the difference of the sum of its decimal digits in even-numbered
positions and the sum of its decimal digits in
odd-numbered positions is divisible by $11$.

First, let's think about the properties of the number $11$. We can make $99$ using $11 \time 9$, Similary, $9999$, $999999$ is possible. This means, one digit number $a \equiv a$ (mod $11$), then two digits number $10 \times b \equiv -b $ (mod $11$) by $11$, because of $10 \equiv -1$ (mod $11$). three digits number $100 \times c \equiv c$ (mod $11$) by $99$, because of $100 = 11\times9 + 1 \equiv 1$ (mod $11$). This property can be applied to any number.

In conclusion, even-numbered positions, $a \times 10 ^ {2n - 1} \equiv a$ (mod $11$) because of $10 ^ {2n - 1} \equiv 1$ (mod $11$), and odd-numbered positions, $b \times 10 ^ {2n} \equiv -b$ (mod $11$), because of $10 ^{2n} \equiv -1$ (mod $11$)

\bigskip
Finally, we can get, if the difference of the sum of its decimal digits in even-numbered positions and the sum of its decimal digits in odd-numbered positions is divisible by $11$,
\begin{align*}
    N & = a_0 \times 1 + a_1 \times 10 + a_2 \times 100 + \cdots + a_n \times 10 ^ n \\
    & \equiv a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + \cdots \pm a_n  \text{ (mod 11)}\\
    & \equiv 0 \text{ (mod 11)}
\end{align*}

So, $N$ is divisible by $11$.

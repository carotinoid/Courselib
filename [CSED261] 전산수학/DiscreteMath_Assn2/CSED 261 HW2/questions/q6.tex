\subsubsection*{Solutions}

Let $r$ be rational number and $i$ be an irrational number. Then, $$\text{Arithmetic Mean} = \frac {i + r} {2}$$ is irrational. Let's prove artihmetic mean is between $r$ and $i$. When $r < i$, then $\displaystyle r < \frac {i + r} {2} < i$. When $r > i$, then $\displaystyle i < \frac {i + r} {2} < r$. Also, addition and division are the closed under irrational number.

So, there is an irrational number between every rational number and every irrational number.

in the same month of the year.
\end{question}

\subsubsection*{Solutions}

$ r \equiv p \rightarrow q$ is the original statement, where $p$ is ``pick 25 days'' and $q$ is ``at least three days fall in the same month''.

\bigskip

\noindent Then, $\neg r \equiv \neg (p \rightarrow q) \equiv p \wedge \neg q$., where $\neg q$ means "at most 2 fall on the same month of the year", which is equivalent to "at most 24 days are picked", $\neg p$.

\bigskip

\noindent Eventually, $\neg r \equiv p \wedge \neg q \equiv p \wedge \neg p$: Contradiction.

\bigskip

\noindent So, the original statement is true.

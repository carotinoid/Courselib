\subsubsection*{Solutions}


Let $G$ be a simple graph. Let $n$ be the number of vertices in $G$. Let $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n$ be the degrees of the vertices of $G$. Since $G$ is simple, the degrees of the vertices are non-negative integers. Since there are $n$ vertices and $n-1$ possible degrees, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree.

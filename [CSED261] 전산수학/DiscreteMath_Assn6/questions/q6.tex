\end{question}

\subsubsection*{Solutions}
Let's prove this statement using induction. When the number of vertices $n = 1$, the graph has no edges, so the statement is true. So, we have to prove that if the statement is true for $n = k$, then it is also true for $n = k + 1$.

\bigskip
Let $G$ be a connected graph with $k + 1$ vertices. Let's remove an arbitrary vertex $v$ from $G$. Then, the graph $G - v$ has $k$ vertices and at least $k - 1$ edges. When we add the vertex $v$ back to the graph, we have to add at least one edge to connect $v$ to the rest of the graph. So, the graph $G$ has at least $k - 1 + 1 = k$ edges. Therefore, the statement is true for $n = k + 1$.

\bigskip
By induction, the statement is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

\subsubsection*{Solutions}


The sum of the entries in a row of the adjacency matrix for an undirected graph is the number of edges connected to the node(vertex), in other words, the degree of the node.
For a directed graph, the sum of them is the out-degree of the node.
In addition, the sum of the entries in a column of the adjacency matrix is also the degree of the node for an undirected graph, and the in-degree of the node for a directed graph.

\begin{question}
Let $n_{1} , n_{2} , ... , n_{t}$ be positive integers. Show that if $n_{1} +n_{2} + \cdots  +n_{t} -t+1$ objects are placed into $t$ boxes, then for some $i,i = 1,2,...,t$, the $i$th box contains at least $n_{i}$ objects.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

We will use the pigeonhole principle with contradiction. Suppose that for all $i, i = 1, 2, \dots, t$, the $i$th box contains less than $n_i$ objects. Then, the number of total objects should be less than $\sum_{i=1}^t n_i = n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_t - t$. However, we have $n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_t - t + 1$ objects, which is a contradiction. Therefore, if $n_{1} +n_{2} + \cdots  +n_{t} -t+1$ objects are placed into $t$ boxes, then for some $i,i = 1,2,...,t$, the $i$th box contains at least $n_{i}$ objects by contrardicion.

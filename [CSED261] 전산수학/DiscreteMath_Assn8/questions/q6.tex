\begin{question}
Two events $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are called independent if $p(E_{1} \cap E_{2}) = p(E_{1})p(E_{2})$. For each of the following pairs of events, which are subsets of the set of all possible outcomes when a coin is tossed three times, determine whether or not they are independent.

\begin{itemize}
\item $E_{1}$: tails comes up with the coin is tossed the first time; $E_{2}$: heads comes up when the coin is tossed the second time.
\end{itemize}
\end{question}

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The probability of $E_1$ is $p(E_1) = \frac{1}{2}$ and the probability of $E_2$ is $p(E_2) = \frac{1}{2}$. The probability of $E_1 \cap E_2$ is $p(E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{1}{4}$. Since $p(E_1 \cap E_2) = p(E_1)p(E_2)$, $E_1$ and $E_2$ are independent events.

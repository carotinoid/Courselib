\subsubsection*{Solutions}

$R^*$ is the transitive closure of $R$, so $R^* = \cup _{i = 1} ^{\infty} R^i$ when $R^1 = R$, $R^n = R^{n-1} \circ R$. To prove this problem, we should show two things:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The composition of two reflexive relations is reflexive.}\\
    Let $R_1, R_2$ are reflexive relations, and $R = R_1 \circ R_2$. Then for all $x \in A$, $xRx$ holds because $xR_1x$ and $xR_2x$ hold. Therefore, $R$ is reflexive.
    \item \textbf{The union of two reflexive relations is reflexive.}\\
    Let $R_1, R_2$ are reflexive relations, and $R = R_1 \cup R_2$. Then for all $x \in A$, $xRx$ holds because $xR_1x$ or $xR_2x$ holds. Therefore, $R$ is reflexive.
\end{enumerate}
Because $R^*$ is constructed as the union and composition of reflexive relations $R$, $R^*$ is reflexive.

\begin{question}
Let R be the relation on the set of ordered pairs of positive integers such that $((a, b), (c, d)) \in R$ if and only if
$ad = bc$. Show that R is an equivalence relation.

\subsubsection*{Solutions}
We have to check the three properties of an equivalence relation: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.\\
\textbf{Reflexivity: } $((a, b), (a, b))$ is in $R$ because $ab = ba$, So $R$ is reflexive.\\
\textbf{Symmetry: } If $((a, b), (c, d))$ is in $R$, then $ad = bc$. So, $((c, d), (a, b))$ is in $R$ because $cb = da$. So, $R$ is symmetric.\\
\textbf{Transitivity: } If $((a, b), (c, d))$ and $((c, d), (e, f))$ are in $R$, then $ad = bc$ and $cf = de$. So, $((a, b), (e, f))$ is in $R$ because $\displaystyle af = \frac {bc} d \cdot \frac {de} c = be$. So, $R$ is transitive.\\

\noindent
So, $R$ is an equivalence relation.
